# Predicting-Startup-Fundings-via-Twitter
Only 1 in 12 startups obtain funding, this competitive nature of financing creates a need for startups to know the likelihood of receiving funding based on their twitter activity. Studies have observed the effect of social media presence on the success of a startup, yet they fail to account for changes in market. We fill this gap by predicting which industries are facing a boom and adjusting likelihood accordingly. 
Our data is threefold, for twitter we scraped tweets and engagement metrics. We utilized Tracxn for funding data from 300+ startups. Pre-processing phase involved lemmatisation using NLTK, identifying links, mentions, emojis, currency conversion, handling missing data. Using a 5 layer sequential keras model we calculated the sentiment score for each tweet. This deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 86.3% while tuning hyper-parameters like dropout rate, L2 regression to prevent overfitting. For the first funding occurrence of a startup we identified the factors which most affect a startups success eg. sentiment scores, engagement rates using Random forrest and LDA. Since our data is imbalanced, we use F-1 score to evaluate the models ability to predict the likelihood of startup receiving funding. We received an overall accuracy of 80% with an f1 score of about 86 for the funded companies.
